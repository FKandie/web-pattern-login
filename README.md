### HTML5-Android-Pattern-LockScreen
A proof of concept project illustrating the use of the Android Pattern LockScreen inside a HTML5 Canvas. This project is written in JavaScript and the canvas manipulation.

This system could be used in some login authentication. It may be extended to be used as a captcha (however, this needs to be POC-ed ^^).

Feel free to commit patches or bugfixes. Any new ideas or notes are welcome.

### Test
- Login
The correct pattern is L from middle or 2589\n\nSwipe from the top first to begin else it wont take you swipe correctly (Code Playground error not mine)\n\nMore features coming soon , maybe ;)
